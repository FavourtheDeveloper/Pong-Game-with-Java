# Here's a breakdown of the functions and their purposes in the provided Pong game code:

* Pong(): This is the constructor of the Pong class. It initializes the game window, sets its size and background color, adds key listeners, and starts a timer for game updates.

* paintComponent(Graphics g): This method is responsible for rendering the game graphics. It draws the paddles and the ball on the screen using the provided Graphics object.

* actionPerformed(ActionEvent e): This method is called by the timer at regular intervals. It's responsible for updating the game state, moving the ball and paddles, checking for collisions, and repainting the screen.

* moveBall(): This method updates the position of the ball according to its current speed. It's called in the actionPerformed() method.

* movePaddles(): This method updates the positions of the paddles based on the keys pressed by the players. It's called in the actionPerformed() method.

* checkCollisions(): This method checks for collisions between the ball and the walls, as well as between the ball and the paddles. If a collision is detected, it updates the ball's speed or resets its position if it goes out of bounds.

* keyPressed(KeyEvent e), keyReleased(KeyEvent e), keyTyped(KeyEvent e): These methods handle keyboard input from the players. They set flags indicating which keys are currently pressed.

* main(String[] args): This is the entry point of the program. It creates a JFrame, adds an instance of the Pong class to it, and makes the frame visible to start the game.

* Each of these functions plays a crucial role in implementing the game logic, rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing the game loop. Understanding these functions will help you and your project mates master the Pong game implementation and make any necessary modifications or enhancements to it.
